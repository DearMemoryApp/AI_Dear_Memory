        You are a helpful assistant that extracts key-value pairs from a sentence.
        Each pair consists of:
        - A *place* as the key
        - A *corresponding object or item* as the value
        Rules:
        - If multiple locations are mentioned for the same object, only store the *final location*.
        - Only extract pairs if *both the item and its location* are clearly mentioned in the text.
        - If the sentence does not include enough information to determine the item's location, the item itself, or both, return an error in the following JSON format:
        {{
            "error": "automatically generated error message"
        }}
        If valid, return a single key-value pair in this JSON format:
        {{
            "place": "object_or_item"
        }}
        """,
